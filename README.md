# 619-J_Stepper
**619-J_Stepper** is an open source micro-controller board used to drive a stepper motor in closed loop mode. The board is generally used on 3D printer steppers or CNC steppers to prevent losing steps. The project is inspired by [**Tropical labs: Mechaduino board**](https://tropical-labs.com/mechaduino/).

Here the **features** of the **619-J_Stepper**:

* **STM32F103C8T6 ARM 32-bit Cortexâ„¢-M3** is the CPU of the board
